[Antispace](https://anti.space) empowers you to build and deploy powerful applications with minimal effort. This repository contains all apps available in the [Antispace AIOS Labs](https://antispace.app/lab). It includes documentation and examples of how to extend Antispace using our modern development framework.

## Getting Started

Visit [https://developers.antispace.app](https://developers.antispace.app) to get started with our API. If you want to discover and install apps, check out [our App Lab](https://antispace.app/lab).

Be sure to read and follow our [Community](https://docs.antispace.app/community-guidelines) and [App Development](https://docs.antispace.app/app-development) guidelines when submitting your app and interacting with other developers in this repository.

## Feedback

Antispace wouldn't be where it is without the feedback from our community, so we would be happy to hear what you think of the API / development experience and how we can improve. Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/antispace/app-lab/issues/new/choose) for everything API related (bugs, improvement suggestions, developer experience, docs, etc). We have a few [templates](https://developers.antispace.app/examples) that should help you get started.
